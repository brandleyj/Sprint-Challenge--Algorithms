#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) 0(n) because it constantly grows depending on input size


b) 0(n^2) having two loops nested causes n squared


c) 0(n) the time increases when the number of inputs does

## Exercise II
stories is n
stories greater than or equal to f is equal to egg broken
stories less than f equals egg not broken

I would set f to n/2 and check if the egg breaks. I would have a condition where if the egg equals broken, decrement f. When the egg isn't broken I would break out of that condition and set f to whatever is decremented to.

Runtime complexity would be 0(n)
